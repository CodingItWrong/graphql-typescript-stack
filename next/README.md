# graphql-typescript-stack/next

See [graphql-typescript-stack README](../README.md) for overview.

The GraphQL query is made on the server side using Suspense, Server Components, and Next's streaming functionality. The query can be seen in [page.tsx](./app/page.tsx).

## Installation

- `yarn install`
- Start the [API](../api/README.md) server locally (defaults to port 4000)
- Run `yarn generate` to update the generated code from the backend GraphQL schema (generated code is committed)

## Running

`yarn dev`
