# graphql-typescript-stack

A proof-of concept stack using GraphQL and TypeScript for type safety across frontend and backend.

## Architecture

- Two clients: SPA React with Vite, and server-rended with Next.js
- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
- Handwritten (not generated) GraphQL schema to guarantee independence from tooling
- Database schema, migrations, and server TypeScript types handled via [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- GraphQL client code and types generated by [`@graphql-codegen`](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/docs/guides/react-vue). Currently using Apollo
